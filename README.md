# battleship

you can see the project [here](https://battleship-first-strike.herokuapp.com/)

## The motivation

A solo project of BeCode training at Brussels. I have 5 days to create it.

Here is the following technologies used:
- Node.js
- OOP to implement the game
- to think your OOP before coding with a UML diagram
- libraries to use:
  + Express.js -> framework for web application
  + Socket.io ->  library for a real-time interaction between a client and web server

## Mission

- Make a mock-up for the design
- create a UML before coding the web application
- Implement a battleship game with Node.js
- Make it appealing

If i have time, i will:
- Implement a "restart game" button
- Show statistic for Win/lose game
- let the player place his ships with a drag and drop feature
- Make it for multiplayer
- Upgrade AI when playing solo
- Place a battle log to see the historic of the game
- put a help feature for player who doesn't know the rule of the game
- design for mobile
